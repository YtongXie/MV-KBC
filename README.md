# MVKBC model for benign-malignant lung nodule classification
Knowledge-based Collaborative Deep Learning for Benign-Malignant Lung Nodule Classification on Chest CT

# Introduction
This repository includes the codes of the MV-KBC model which has been published by IEEE-TMI.

# Dependencies
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Python 2.7

#  LIDC-IDRI Dataset
The LIDC-IDRI Dataset used for the experimentation can be found in https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI.

# Lung nodule extraction
The tool in https://github.com/taznux/lung-image-analysis is used to extract lung nodules and labels.
